`Contributing <https://github.com/vijinho/skeleton>`__
=======================================================

Feedback
--------

This is by far the easiest way to contribute something. If you're using
code from my project for your own project, don't hesitate sharing. It
doesn't have to be a high-class enterprise app, obviously. It's just
incredibly motivating to know that people use the things you develop and
what it enables them to do. If you have something that you would like to
tell me, please don't hesitate. Screenshots and videos are also very
welcome! I'm also interested in the problems you had when getting
started. Please feel encouraged to report any obstacles you encountered
such as missing documentation, misleading directions or similar. Even if
it's just a typo, let me know.

`Reporting an Issue <http://kivy.org/docs/contribute.html#reporting-an-issue>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you found anything wrong, a crash, segfault, missing documentation,
invalid spelling, weird example, please take 2 minutes to report the
issue. following the guide lines mentioned
`here <http://kivy.org/docs/contribute.html#reporting-an-issue>`__ at
`Pocket Philosopher Issues <https://github.com/vijinho/skeleton/issues>`__

`Code Contributions <http://kivy.org/docs/contribute.html#code-contributions>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code contributions (patches, new features) are the most obvious way to
help with the project's development. Since this is so common I ask you
to follow the Kivy workflow to most efficiently work with me. Adhering
to the workflow ensures that your contribution won't be forgotten or
lost. Also, your name will always be associated with the change you
made, which basically means eternal fame in our code history (you can
opt-out if you don't want that).

`Documentation Contributions <http://kivy.org/docs/contribute.html#documentation-contributions>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation contributions generally follow the same workflow as code
contributions, just a bit more lax. I don't ask you to go through all
the hassle just to correct a single typo. For more complex
contributions, please consider following the suggested workflow though.

Use the same approach as the ``Code Workflow`` to `submit new
